# RFIDSafe
Simple RFID safe conversion project

I decided to convert my cheap Walmart keypad safe to work via RFID (either keycards or implants), by using an Arduino UNO and a PN532 breakout board (along with an N-channel MOSFET to drive the solenoid).

The code is incredibly simple, most of it is just the base example for UIDs from the Adafruit PN532 library. Figured this could still help some people who want to do similar projects.

More info (including wiring info and pictures) coming soon.
